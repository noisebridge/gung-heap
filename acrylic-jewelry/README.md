Laser the design on 1/8 inch acrylic!

Use standard jewelry findings to put your necklace and earrings together. I've got earring hooks, ribbon, ribbon clamps, and jump rings. Note that you actually want smaller jump rings than I have pictured, so that it fits through the acrylic hole more easily (you can also make the hole diameters bigger in Inkscape or something), and so that that the curved spike shape will fit through itself.
