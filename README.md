## Noisebridge Gung Heap

Did you assemble a project at Noisebridge? Spend 15-30 minutes writing a brief guide.


### Why?

1. To empower others to learn from your success
2. To share knowledge with the people after you 


### What?

All projects small and large, software and hardware, technical, artistic, and otherwise.

**Test:** Would others want to learn about your project and maybe try repeating it?

Things that don't go here:
1. Noisebridge Infrastructure - put it in the [wiki](noisebridge.net)


### Stuff You Need

1. All the files that someone needs to perform your project in a directory named after your project: `your-project`
2. A quick outline of how to perform your project in: `your-project/README.md`


### Tips

1. Avoid long sentences and long explanations
2. Assume your reader knows how to use all tools and software
3. Infrastructure projects go on the wiki at [noisebridge.net](noisebridge.net)


### Simple Walkthrough

1. Use `example` and `example/README.md` as a template for `your-project` and `your-project/README.md`
2. **make a pull request** (only do this if you don't need help)
    - If you can't make a pull request, just use the detailed walkthrough


### Detailed Walkthrough 

Don't worry about getting things wrong, go for it.

1. **download** a `zip` file of this repository
2. **choose** a hyphenated project name (eg. `your-project`)
3. **copy** `example/README.md` to `your-project/README.md`
4. **make** a directory with the same name `your-project`
5. **add** project files in the directory
6. **zip** the `gung-heap` folder into `gung-heap.zip` and send it to `robbintt (at) gmail.com`
    - Please include the subject line `Noisebridge gung heap submission: your-project`


### What about the wiki?

The wiki is a datastore, definitely put stuff there. Things can go here and there.
