### Rotating Phone Holder

This project is laser cut out of acrylic and wood components.

The two straps hold the phone onto the plate. The bottom crossbar supports the A frame, the top crossbar supports the A frame and supports the phone and plate mechanism.

Sorry there are so many files. Carefully plan which ones you will use.

Please read the instructions carefully.

Please ensure that all teeth fit based on your material thickness **before** buying the material :-)  

Modifying the inkscape file is possible. I used constructive solid geometry to build each shape and placed each based on mm coordinates from the origin.


#### Project Status: completed


#### Author: Trent


#### Date Added: March 23, 2017


#### Future Improvements

Please adjust the file so that the phone sits on the crossbar in landscape mode. This needs testing and/or thought so that the phone camera is not blocked by the horizontal support bar.


#### Bill of Materials

This project uses up to 3 different laser cut materials and `careful planning` because the documentation is not perfect.


1. Wood for the two "A" frames (because it's cheaper)
    - I used 1/8 inch thick wood. 1/4 inch would probably be even better.
2. 3mm Acrylic Sheet for the plate, straps, and turning mechanism
    - Please verify this in the inkscape file before you buy it.
3. 1cm Acrylic Sheet (
3. 6x machine screws and matching nuts
    - PLEASE ADD: The screw length and thickness needs recovered by looking at the plates and rotating mechanisms
4. Super glue, epoxy, or other acrylic glue
    - for permanently fixing the teeth of the rotating mechanism to the plate that holds the phone.



#### Tools

A list of tools that were used to do the work.

1. Laser Cutter - Kaitian CM1309
2. Toothpicks for applying glue
3. Something to hold the plate to the rotating mechanism while the glue dries


#### Software

A list of software and current version used when the project was done.

1. Inkscape 0.48.4 r9939 (Jan 22 2014)
2. RDWorks 8.0.0.8 with Proprietary Kaitian modifications 
    - AKA: the progra for connecting to our Kaitian CM1309 Laser Cutter


#### Howto

This project is performed on the laser cutter.

Ensure the teeth will fit based on your exact material thickness.


Rough Steps (please think the project out, I did this writeup quickly!)

1. Cut the A frames out of wood. Thicker is better, but I used wood approximately a quarter inch thick with minimal bowing.
    - Ensure the holes in the A Frame will accomodate your crossbar thickness!!
2. Cut the two crossbars out of the thicker acrylic.
3. Cut the rotating mechanisms, plate, and straps out of the thin acrylic.
4. Make the two 'coins' thinner by engraving each.
    - To do this, import `engravesquare.dxf` in rdworks, place the coin within the square, and engrave the square
    
    - The result will be a coin slightly thinner than the round hole in the coin-holder
    - The 'coin holder' is the thing attached to the 'plate' with several teeth.
    - OPTION: add the engraving to your rdworks file and upload it here for others to have an easier time.
