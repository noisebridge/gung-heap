# locker shelves

I made some locker shelves. You can laser cut them at noisebridge. I
used 1/5" plywood. They're kind of a tight fit, but it works well that
way.

Since it's OpenSCAD, you can change the dimensions!

For some reason importing into the laser scales it slightly (30 inches
becomes 33 inches) so I multiplied all the dimensions by 30/33. ðŸ¤·
